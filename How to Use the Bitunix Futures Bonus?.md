<p>Please note: If you already have an active futures bonus, redeeming a new bonus will invalidate the current one.</p>

<p>After redemption, you can check the balance of your active bonus on the futures trading page. The balance will be displayed in the <strong>Assets</strong> section at the lower right corner.</p>

<p>If your position incurs a loss while the bonus is still valid, the loss will be deducted from the active bonus balance when you close the position.</p>


<p>If you transfer funds from the futures account to the spot account, the futures bonus will be canceled and recalled.</p>

<h2>Important Notes:</h2>
<p>When the futures bonus expires, it will be deducted from the available balance, which could increase the risk of forced liquidation if the position is in cross margin mode. It is highly recommended that users manage their risk and adjust position margins accordingly.</p>

<h2>What is the Bitunix Futures Bonus?</h2>
<p>The Bitunix Futures Bonus is a reward offered to users of the Bitunix platform through various promotions and activities. It can be used for contract trading products, giving new users the opportunity to explore and experience Bitunix's trading features in a live environment without any risk.</p>

<h2>Is the Futures Bonus the Same as Real Assets?</h2>
<p>No, the Futures Bonus is not considered real assets. It is credited to the user's futures trading account to allow them to experience futures trading. These funds cannot be transferred to the Spot account for spot trading or withdrawn.</p>
<p>While the Futures Bonus cannot be transferred or withdrawn, users can still use it in futures trading. Any profits made from trading with the bonus can be withdrawn, but losses will be deducted from the bonus until it is depleted.</p>

<h2>How Can I Check My Received Futures Bonus?</h2>
<p>Users can view their earned Futures Bonus by going to <strong>Assets</strong> and then selecting <strong>Coupon Center</strong>.</p>

<h2>Rules for Using the Futures Bonus</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Futures Bonus can be used as margin to open positions.</li>
    <li>Only one Futures Bonus can be redeemed at a time.</li>
    <li>It can be used to offset handling fees when opening or closing positions.</li>
    <li>The Futures Bonus can also offset losses from closed positions in futures trading.</li>
    <li>During the use of the bonus, the user will not be entitled to commission rebates on the credited portion of the commission.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations of the Futures Bonus</h2>
<ul>
    <li>If the Futures Bonus is not redeemed within the validity period, it will expire.</li>
    <li>Only one Futures Bonus can be redeemed at a time. Redeeming a new bonus while one is already in use will result in the old bonus being recalled.</li>
    <li>Any transfer of funds from the futures account before the bonus is fully used will cause the current Futures Bonus to expire.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Important Transfer Rules:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>When transferring funds out of the futures account, the available balance for transfer equals the userâ€™s assets minus the position margin. After the transfer, any active Futures Bonus will become invalid.</li>
    <li>If a transfer from the futures account could lead to forced liquidation of a position, the system will prevent the transfer. However, if the transfer does not trigger forced liquidation, it will be allowed, and any used Futures Bonus will be invalidated. In cross margin mode, this may increase the risk of forced liquidation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Futures Bonus Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Bitunix reserves the right to suspend an account if malicious use of the Futures Bonus or other inappropriate behavior is detected to recover any losses.</p>
